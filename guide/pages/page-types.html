<h2>Page Types</h2>
<p>There are a few different types of page templates to choose from. Each designed for a specific content type so it's important that you consult this section before deciding which one to use.</p>
<h3>Dashboards</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/dashboard-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/dashboard-light-mobile.gif" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Responsive Dashboard</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	The dashboard template should always used for the primary landing page of each app. If tabbed content is used for more complex apps, a dashboard page should then be used for each section, under the first tab.
</p>
<p>
	Dashboards provide snippets of content from each tab or section to create a quick snapshot overview for the user. This helps him gain the most important data and information quickly without diving in too deep.
</p>
<p class="important">
	Dashboards are responsive and using the <span class="code">slick.js</span> plugin, it collapses into a swipe-able slider on smaller screens. Make sure you include the necessary classes to enable this feature.
</p>
<p>
	Dasboards can be used for all sorts of con8tent but they are most effective when combined with data visualization.
</p>
<p class="important">
	Dashboards are configurable using the various grid sizes, so do not feel like you have to stick with the current configuration. Also for taller content consider adding overflow scroll to the panel content itself.
</p>
<h3>Internal page</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/internal-page-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/internal-page-light-mobile.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Blank internal page</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	Standard internal pages use the <span class="code">.full-panel</span> container. this is full width but has a gap at the top and bottom. If contextual tools are required they sit  above the panel.
</p>
<h3>Article pages</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/article-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/article-light-mobile.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Example of article lists</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	Articles a slightly different to other pages in that they float in the centre of the <span class="code">.full-panel</span>. They also have a smaller max-width of 700px for easier legibility.
</p>
<h3>Interactive maps</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/interactive-map-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/interactive-map-light-mobile.gif" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Responsive interactive map</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	The interactive map is used for listed items that display on an adjacent map. Usually this will be its own page, but can theoretically be combined with other content below or above. The height of the map is defined by the height of the viewport using <span class="code">vh</span> units.
</p>
<p>
	On mobile, the map and list can be toggled between by tapping each side of the screen.
