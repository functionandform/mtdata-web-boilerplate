<h2>Elements and Styles</h2>
<p>
	We have provided styles for many possible componants and requirements. But if we have missed something simply add a feature request to the <a href="https://github.com/toddpadwick/mtdata-web-boilerplate/">Github page</a>.
</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<img src="screens/typography.jpg" width="75%" alt="" style="margin:0 0 24px 0; border:3px solid #EDEDED; border-radius:5px;">
<p class="small">Typographic styles</p>
<p>Various typographic styles are present to allow for different data elements and content types.</p>
<p>
	Colour is also used with data element typography to highlight monetary values, and currencies are displayed using css <span class="code">::before</span> elements.
</p>
<h3>Tables</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/table-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/table-light-mobile.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Responsive tables</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	Tables are placed full width within the <span class="code">.full-panel</span> container. They are also responsive, so are swipe-able on smaller screens.
</p>
<h3>Forms</h3>
<img src="screens/forms.jpg" width="75%" alt="" style="margin:0 0 24px 0; border:3px solid #EDEDED; border-radius:5px;">
<p>
	Form elements all include validation alerts and focus states. They also have placement for icons to help suggest what type of content should be entered in each field. If the icon is an action such as search functionality, the icon is coloured blue and on the right. But if they icon is just illustrative, it is grey and on the left.
</p>
<p class="important">
	It is important to be careful not to over-use labels. Rather than having for example, a label for First name, and last name... simply include one label for 'full name', and use placeholders to show first name and last name. This helps make forms simpler to follow for the user.

<h3>Overlay windows</h3>
