<h2>Elements and Styles</h2>
<p>
	We have provided styles for many possible componants and requirements. But if we have missed something simply add a feature request to the <a href="https://github.com/toddpadwick/mtdata-web-boilerplate/">Github page</a>.

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>Various typographic styles are present to allow for different data elements and content types.</p>
<p>
	Colour is also used with data element typography to highlight monetary values, and currencies are displayed using css <span class="code">::before</span> elements.
