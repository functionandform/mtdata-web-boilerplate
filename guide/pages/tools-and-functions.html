<h2>Tools and Functions</h2>
<p>
	The web app UI has many different methods of displaying tools and functions. But choosing the right one for the right type of tool is important. 
</p>
<h3>The global toolbar</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">

	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">

	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Placement of global tools</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	The global toolbar is for all tools that are relavant no matter where you are on the site. These are usually the same or atleast similar for every app. such as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>User profile</li>
	<li>Messages</li>
	<li>Alerts</li>
	<li>Theme switcher</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The theme switcher is the only compulsory function in the global toolbar. This allows users to toggle between the dark theme and light theme depending on their lighting environment.
</p>
<h3>Contextual floating action menu</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/floating-action-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/floating-action-light-mobile.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">The floating action menu</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	The floating action button expands on click to reveal more options (max 3). However it can be just used as one single button. This is for any options that relate directly to that section. Such as adding more content like a new driver or vehicle.
</p>
<p class="important">The floating button is not compulsory. Do not use it if there is not a good reason to do so, and only if it is 100% obvious what it will do.</p>
<h3>Contextual toolbar</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/contextual-tools-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/contextual-tools-light-mobile.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Page specific contextual tools</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	The contextual toolbar is placed beneath the tabs and (if tabs are used) placed in the ajax page content itself. It is specifically for tools that are specific for the page content beneath them such as search fields, filters and modifiers.
</p>
<p class="important">
	Be careful not to overuse this toolbar. You can only fit 2 items at the most due to smaller screen devices. They should always be left or right aligned. Not centre aligned.
