<h2>Navigational Structure</h2>
<p>
	To keep things as simple and intuitive for the user we have strict rules regarding navigation.
</p>
<h3>Top level navigation</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/top-nav-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/top-nav-light-mobile.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Responsive top level navigation</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	Top level navigation is displayed on the footer bar on mobile, and on the sidebar on desktop. These are short section titles that breakdown your app into a maximum of 5 sections. Each section has an icon and label. There are further navigational tools to breakdown content even further once in these sections.
</p>
<p class="important">
	However complex your app maybe, you must limit your top level navigational items to 5 or less. The reason being is that we do not collapse the navigation into a hidden menu on mobile. Instead they are always displayed on the footer so that it is very easy for the user to quickly switch between them.
</p>
<h3>Tabs</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/tabs-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<div class="browser-ui mobile">
		<img src="screens/tabs-light-mobile.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Tabbed navigation</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	When the top level navigation is not enough to breakdown content, we introduce the tabs. Tabs seperate content within each top level section. They pull in pages using ajax, and are technically limitless as they can be swipeable on smaller screens. But we do suggest trying to contain them to 4 or less. To link each page simply add the <span class="code">#pagename</span> to the tab anchor link without <span class="code">.html</span> affix.
</p>
<p>
	Tabs help seperate content within each top level navigation so they should be related but are also self contained pages.
</p>
<h3>Breadcump navigation</h3>
<div class="browsers">
	<div class="browser-ui">
		<img src="screens/breadcrumb-light-desktop.jpg" alt="">
	</div><!-- browser-ui -->
	<p class="small">Non responsive breadcrumb</p>
</div><!-- browsers -->
<p>
	 The breadcrumb is secondary navigation that reveals the user's location in the apps heirachi. The term comes from the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale in which the two title children drop breadcrumbs to form a trail back to their home.
</p>
<p>
	This navigation is especially helpful to the user when they have dived into a sections specific details such as an item from a list, or further options expanded from a particular content item. 
</p>
<p>
	This navigation is not visible on mobile however, as its much easier to go backwards on a mobile device.
