Please note before making changes:
The UI kit is build using SCSS. So changes made to css must be made in the SASS files and compiled.
Both SCSS and Javascript are both compiled using prepros.io. Prepros config files are included.
Please ensure designs are still followed when using this kit. This will prevent componants being mis-used.
Navigation structures need to be discussed with designer first. Over-arching sidebar nav should never have more than 5 sections. Within each section, tabs can be used for further navigation.
