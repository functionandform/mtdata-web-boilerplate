# mtdata-web-boilerplate
web UI boiler plate

This is a UI kit for all of MTData's web app projects.

Before development:
The UI kit uses SCSS so please do not edit or change css files. Only edit files in the SASS folders.
Prepros is used to compile sass and javascript files. Json files are included with compile configs.
Ajax is used for tab loading and pulling SVG icons so previewing development will only work from a server environment.
